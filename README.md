# *C. difficle* Gut Microbiome Colonization in Relation to Diet Study 

This repository includes all files produced/required to run Qiime2 core diversity analysis on the total sum scaled biom table for the gut microbiome study. The jupyter notebook that includes the script for the core diversity analysis in Qiime2 is included. 

## To Do: 

  - make a snakemake workflow 
  - upload pred_metagenome_contrib.tsv.gz at some point 
  - clean up R functions and double check correctness of biom tables going into plots
  - create visualizations of statistical results 
  - link taxonomic information to qiime core plots
